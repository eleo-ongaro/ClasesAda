            <p>Yep!..That's me!
                You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation...
                It started when I was a kid. Always interested in technology and design.
                I did some courses and studied self-taught.
                Yes, nerd from the cradle 🤓.
                Different fears and life situations led me to study other things in other areas, but now I find myself getting back into the ring more excited than ever!
                I find myself studying:
                👩🏻💻 FrontEnd Programming
                
                I have a strong focus on finding solutions, achieving accessibility, always focusing on the users, with beautiful designs ✨
                
                It's getting long, isn't it? 🤔
                So to finish, I'll tell you what other skills stand out to me, of which many are thanks to my previous training (clearly I know how to nurture and improve myself, taking advantage of all the situations that serve me, no? 😝):
                - love to work in a team
                - very good communication skills
                - unquenchable thirst for always learning more
                - enthusiastic
                - proactive
                - committed
                - responsible
                - I encourage constructive criticism to improve myself
                - I am self-critical
                And much more!
                
                Would you like to give me the opportunity?</p>
